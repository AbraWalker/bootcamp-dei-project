(Code Institute) HTML/CSS/Bootstrap Individual Project - Diversity and Inclusion

## INTRODUCTION

![LGBT ABCs Banner](/docs/images/banner.png)


My submission for my first individual project is [Name of Website], a website that uses HTML, CSS and Bootstrap
to provide basic information about the LGBTQ+ community and their rights within workplace and educational environments, intended to educate and
inform people who may know little about the subject.

The live version of this project can be found <a href="https://abrawalker.github.io/bootcamp-dei-project/" target="blank">here.</a>

## USER STORIES
User stories are further explored in the project's dedicated board.

- As a visitor, I want the webpage to be easy to navigate, so I can look up specific information about the topics I’m interested in.
- As a person unfamiliar with the community, I want a basic introduction to keywords and phrases used to describe LGBTQ+ people.
- As an LGBTQ+ person, I want access to resources and further information to learn my rights as an LGBTQ+ person at work/school.
- As an educator, I want information provided in a formal, clear way with language and concepts that are accessible to people of all ages.
- As a person who works in HR, I want a clear list of guidelines and practices to make an environment comfortable for LGBTQ+ staff.
- As an ally, I want resources with information to support LGBTQ+ people and learn more about LGBTQ+ rights.
- As a user, I want to be able to access this site on any device, so I can share it to other interested users.
